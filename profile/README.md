# Georgia Tech's Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH)

As the demand for high-performance computing grows, our ability to speed up computers by creating faster and fster transistors is reaching the end of the road. How can we  rethink—even “reboot”—computing technology to restart the historic exponential performance growth we’ve experienced over the past five decades? This is the premise underlying the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH), an Interdisciplinary Research Center at Georgia Tech. Our researchers are poised on the forefront of the next computing revolution, investigating promising new methods while teaming with industry, academic, and government partners to take advantage of the new knowledge our research is revealing.
